# ThunderbirdLauncher
A script which helps you launch Thunderbird For Windows on logon in minimized mode.

### Description
  I wrote this script when I find Thunderbird cannot start automatically. Normally, it works as long as we write a simple script which runs the program in minimized mode and add it to the task scheduler. However, I found that ThunderBird will always pop up after several trials. Then I wrote this one to solve this problem. The languages used in this script are VBScript and PowerShell.
  
### Usage
  You may need to change some parameters to make it work better for you.
